# php_form
Signup, Login and some other actions using php (a simple model)

JUST SOME INSTRUCTIONS...

FOR THIS CODE TO RUN, U NEED TO STORE THE FILES IN htdocs FOLDER OF xammp.
OPEN THE XAMMP AND MAKE apache AND mysql RUN.
I USED sqlyog TO STORE THE DATABASE. U CAN ALSO USE mysql.
NOW CREATE A NEW CONNECTION IN sqlyog, CREATE A DATABASE AND A TABLE.
MAKE SURE THE username,pswd,database NAMES ,TABLE AND ITS FIELDS NAMES MATCHES WITH THAT IN MY CODE.
GOOD LUCK N THANKS...:)
